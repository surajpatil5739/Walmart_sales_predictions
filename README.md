# Walmart_sales_predictions
The Probem Statement On kaggle competition read as follows :

You are provided with historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each 
store contains a number of departments, and you are tasked with predicting the department-wide 
sales for each store. In addition, Walmart runs several promotional markdown events throughout 
the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of which are the Super 
Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five 
times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks. Part of the challenge presented by this 
competition is modeling the effects of markdowns on these holiday weeks in the absence of 
complete/ideal historical data.

Work done on it by me is follows:

-Understood the competition requirement by reading the competition details.<br />
-Decided the required approach of data exploration by using  matplotlib , seaborn etc.<br />
-Understood the insites of the data.<br />
-Performed feature engineering , scaling and imputation using different tools available in sckit-learn.<br />
-Trained two models (Randomforestregressor and XGBRegressor ). <br />
-Did Hyperparameter tuning of models.<br />
-Trained the final models and predicted the sales using it. <br />
-Took the average of the sales predicted by models.<br />
